### Project Description:
In this assignment I requested my own API key to use AJAX JSON APIs to make a program that displays movie information.

### View Project:
 https://analisalee.github.io/lesson8_ajax/.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data
2. API key often acts as both a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication, and will
    generally have a set of access rights on the API associated with it
3. I learned that JSON statements are set up like: key:value
4. The HTTP request allows AJAX to work and give an HTTP Response
5. I also learned you need a URL to display your unique API key.
